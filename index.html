  <h1>This is a test...</h1>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Yea, it's still a test, but we are really workin' at it...</p>

  <p>That's a lie, this is designed to be a test. A test of CSS and Java and probably bootstrap as well. Yea learning!
     Hopefully this will become more complex overtime, and maybe even develop into a portfolio. Just wait and see...</p>
